    "## RAGAS Answer Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment of Answer Correctness involves measuring the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness.\n",
    "Answer correctness  is computed as the sum of factual correctness and the semantic similarity between the given answer and the ground truth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Factual correctness is a metric that compares and evaluates the factual accuracy of the generated response with the reference. This metric is used to determine the extent to which the generated response aligns with the reference. The factual correctness score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. To measure the alignment between the response and the reference, the metric uses the LLM to first break down the response and reference into claims and then uses natural language inference to determine the factual overlap between the response and the reference. Factual overlap is quantified using precision, recall, and F1 score, which can be controlled using the mode parameter. By default, the mode is set to F1, you can change the mode to precision or recall by setting the mode parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer similarity is calculated by following steps:  \n",
    "Step 1: Vectorize the ground truth answer using the embedding model.  \n",
    "Step 2: Vectorize the generated answer using the same embedding model.  \n",
    "Step 3: Compute the cosine similarity between the two vectors.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "By default \"text-embedding-ada-002\" model is used. In that evaluation, we used Text Embedding 004 (Google).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Final score is created by taking a weighted average of the factual correctness (F1 score) and the semantic similarity. \n",
    "(By default, there is a 0.75 : 0.25 weighting.)   \n",
    "\n",
    "Total API Calls: 4  \n",
    "* 1 LLM call to produce the \"simple statements  \n",
    "* 1 LLM call to determine the true positives, false positives, and false negatives  \n",
    "* 1 embedding call to embed the context  \n",
    "* 1 embedding call to embed the AI answer  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsuccesful experiment with Gemini 2.5 flash:  \n",
    "Because the generated results are non-deterministic, I run evaluation 3 times and calculate the mean. To evaluate 370 questions x 3 times x 2 (vanilla and RAG) X 4 API calls = 8880 API calls total for one set of results. When I decided to play with Gemini 2.5 flash, ​I also calculated other metrics, in total it cost 16000 API calls and 167 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: I will stick with Gemini 2.0 flash model as a main judge for the rest of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel like RAGAS use much more in terms of LLM calls than just 4 as they say in documentation. I didn't examine it properly, but there is a [source code](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/blob/main/ragas/src/ragas/metrics/_answer_correctness.py).\n",
    "There is a [compaint](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dbmqii/i_spent_700_on_evaluating_100_rag_qa_set_using/) about RAGAS costing 700$ for 100 QA set.      \n",

    "Faithfulness measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from the answer and the retrieved context. The answer is scaled to the (0, 1) range. The higher the better. \n",
    "The generated answer is regarded as faithful if all the claims made in the answer can be inferred from the given context.  \n",
    "At the first step, the generated answer is broken down into individual statements.     \n",
    "Then each of these claims is cross-checked with the given context to determine if it can be inferred from the context.    \n",
    "The final score is calculated by dividing the number of claims that can be inferred from the context by the total number of claims in the generated response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Groundedness, sometimes referred to as faithfulness, measures whether the response is based completely on the context. It validates that the response isn't using information other than what exists in the context. A low groundedness metric indicates that the language model might be outputting inaccurate or nonsensical responses.  A low groundedness calculation indicates that the language model doesn't see the chunks as relevant. You should evaluate whether you need to add data to your collection, adjust your chunking strategy or chunk size, or fine-tune your prompt.  \n",
