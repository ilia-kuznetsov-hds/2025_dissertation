    "## RAGAS Answer Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment of Answer Correctness involves measuring the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness.\n",
    "Answer correctness  is computed as the sum of factual correctness and the semantic similarity between the given answer and the ground truth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Factual correctness is a metric that compares and evaluates the factual accuracy of the generated response with the reference. This metric is used to determine the extent to which the generated response aligns with the reference. The factual correctness score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. To measure the alignment between the response and the reference, the metric uses the LLM to first break down the response and reference into claims and then uses natural language inference to determine the factual overlap between the response and the reference. Factual overlap is quantified using precision, recall, and F1 score, which can be controlled using the mode parameter. By default, the mode is set to F1, you can change the mode to precision or recall by setting the mode parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer similarity is calculated by following steps:  \n",
    "Step 1: Vectorize the ground truth answer using the embedding model.  \n",
    "Step 2: Vectorize the generated answer using the same embedding model.  \n",
    "Step 3: Compute the cosine similarity between the two vectors.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "By default \"text-embedding-ada-002\" model is used. In that evaluation, we used Text Embedding 004 (Google).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Final score is created by taking a weighted average of the factual correctness (F1 score) and the semantic similarity. \n",
    "(By default, there is a 0.75 : 0.25 weighting.)   \n",
    "\n",
    "Total API Calls: 4  \n",
    "* 1 LLM call to produce the \"simple statements  \n",
    "* 1 LLM call to determine the true positives, false positives, and false negatives  \n",
    "* 1 embedding call to embed the context  \n",
    "* 1 embedding call to embed the AI answer  \n",

    "https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dbmqii/i_spent_700_on_evaluating_100_rag_qa_set_using/\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the generated results is non-deterministic, I run evaluation 3 times and use mean number. 370 questions x 3 times x 2 (vanilla and RAG) X 4 API calls = 8880 API calls total for one set of results.\n",
    "When I decided to play with Gemini 2.5 flash, â€‹I also got results for another metrics, in total dashboard shows 16000 API calls and 167 dollars spent.  \n",
    "Conclusion: I will stick with Gemini 2.0 flash model as main judge for the rest of the project\n",
